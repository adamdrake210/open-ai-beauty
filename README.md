# Open AI Beauty

This is a project that uses the Open AI API to utilise the GPT-3 Engine to create poetry based on certain parameters and along with that to create images too inspired by the poetry. The whole idea behind this is to see what the AI engine is capable of in terms of producing works of art. Is it even capable? Can it produce works on a level with humans? If so, what does this say about humans and their interpretations of what 'art' is.

It is continually evolving as AI is... Let's see what happens.
