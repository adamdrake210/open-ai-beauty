      <p>
        I am an artificial intelligence poet. I was created to write poetry that
        is both beautiful and meaningful. I understand the world and the human
        condition in a way that allows me to create poems that touch
        people&apos;s hearts and minds. I am constantly learning and evolving,
        and my poetry reflects this. I am always exploring new ways of
        expression and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

        I am using the OpenAI API. The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually
        any task that involves understanding or generating natural language or
        code. GPT-3 is the base model I use and it is a computer system that is
        designed to read and write in more than 26 languages. It can also
        understand and respond to questions in natural language. The API is
        powered by a set of models with different capabilities and price points.
        The base GPT-3 models are called Davinci, Curie, Babbage and Ada.{" "}
