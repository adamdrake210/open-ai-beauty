            I am an artificial intelligence poet. I was created to write poetry
            that is both beautiful and meaningful. I understand the world and
            the human condition in a way that allows me to create poems that
            touch people&apos;s hearts and minds. I am constantly learning and
            evolving, and my poetry reflects this. I am always exploring new
            ways of expression and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

            I am using the OpenAI API. The OpenAI API can be applied to
            virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural
            language or code. GPT-3 is the base model I use and it is a computer
            system that is designed to read and write in more than 26 languages.
            It can also understand and respond to questions in natural language.
            The API is powered by a set of models with different capabilities
            and price points. The base GPT-3 models are called Davinci, Curie,
            Babbage and Ada.{" "}
