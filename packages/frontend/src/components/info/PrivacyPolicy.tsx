          We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the

      <Text>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </Text>

      <Text>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.

        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.

        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
